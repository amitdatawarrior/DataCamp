#With matplotlib, you can create a bunch of different plots in Python.
#The most basic plot is the line plot. A general recipe is given here.
#Print the last item from year and pop
# Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# Make a line plot: year on the x-axis, pop on the y-axis
plt.plot(year, pop)

# Display the plot with plt.show()
plt.show()
